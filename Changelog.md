## [Unreleased] - ReleaseDate

### Added

- Added `push()` method to all root structs to insert a single extension-struct in the pointer chain. (#909)
- Update Vulkan-Headers to 1.3.296 (#910)
- Added `VK_KHR_get_display_properties2` instance extension (#932)
- Added `VK_EXT_metal_objects` device extension (#942)
- Added `VK_AMD_anti_lag` device extension (#943)
- Added `VK_KHR_video_queue`, `VK_KHR_video_encode_queue`, and `VK_KHR_video_decode_queue` device extensions (#965)

### Changed

- Enable passing mutable arrays of `pNext`-initialized structs for these remaining extension functions: (#966)
  - `VK_EXT_tooling_info`: `get_physical_device_tool_properties()`;
  - `VK_KHR_cooperative_matrix`: `get_physical_device_cooperative_matrix_properties()`;
  - `VK_KHR_pipeline_executable_properties`:
    - `get_pipeline_executable_internal_representations()`;
    - `get_pipeline_executable_properties()`;
    - `get_pipeline_executable_statistics()`.
  The expected length of this array can be queried with the respective `*_len()` variant of these functions.
- `push_next()` has been renamed to `extend()` and marked as `unsafe`. Users are encouraged to call `push()` for singular structs instead. (#909)
- Changed and renamed `RawPtr::as_raw_ptr(&self)` trait function to a by-value `RawPtr::to_raw_ptr(self)` function. (#965)
- All `Extends{Root}` traits have been replaced with a single `Extends<Root>` trait using generics. (#971)
- Moved `push()` and `extend()` methods from individual Vulkan structs (builders) into the `TaggedStructure` trait. (#994)
  This trait must be imported in scope (`use ash::vk::TaggedStructure as _;`) to use the `push()` and `extend()` methods.

### Removed

- Removed unused lifetime from `vk::AllocationCallbacks` structure (#968)
- Removed `ash::prelude` and `ash::vk::prelude` in favour of capturing all contents directly in their parent module. (#972)

## [0.38.0] - 2024-04-01

With over two years of collecting breaking changes (since the `0.37.0` release in March 2022), April 2024 marks the next breaking release of `ash`.  This release introduces an overhaul of all Vulkan structures, restructures modules around extensions, and separates extension wrappers between `Instance` and `Device` functions.  The crate contains all bindings defined by the latest `1.3.281` Vulkan specification, and many old and new extensions have received a hand-written extension wrapper.  For a full overview of all individual changes, see the list at the end of this post.

### Replaced builders with lifetimes/setters directly on Vulkan structs

All `Builder` structs have been removed, and their builder functions and lifetime generic have moved to the underlying Vulkan struct.  This means all types will carry the lifetime information of contained references at all times, when created using the builder pattern.

Where one used to call:

```rust
let queue_info = [vk::DeviceQueueCreateInfo::build()
    .queue_family_index(queue_family_index)
    .queue_priorities(&priorities)
    .build()];
```

Which drops lifetime information about the `&priorities` slice borrow, one now writes:

```rust
let queue_info = [vk::DeviceQueueCreateInfo::default()
    .queue_family_index(queue_family_index)
    .queue_priorities(&priorities)];
```

And `queue_info` relies on the borrow checker to ensure it cannot outlive `&priorities`.

### Separating extension loaders and wrappers between `instance` and `device` functions

Just like the separation between `InstanceFnV1_x` and `Device_FnV1_x` for Vulkan core functions, all extensions now have a separate generated `InstanceFn` and `DeviceFn` function pointer table (when containing one or more functions), separating out the two.

High-level extension wrappers are updated to match via a separate `Instance` and `Device` struct inside a module carrying the extension name (see also below), instead of residing in a single struct.  These modules are generated for all extensions including those without functions (for which no `Instance` or `Device` struct is generated), complete with a reexport of the extension name and version.

### Restructuring of modules around extensions, function-pointer tables and high-level wrappers

Function pointer tables for both core and extensions have moved out of the "pure" `sys`-like `ash::vk::` module, into the `ash::` root for core `*FnV1_x` tables and into the extension module `ash::<prefix>::<extension name>::{InstanceFn, DeviceFn}` for extensions.  High-level wrappers for these structs (originally from the `ash::extensions` module), together with the `Instance` and `Device` structure split detailed above, have also moved into this module.

For example, `ash::vk::KhrSwapchainFn` is now available as `ash::khr::swapchain::{InstanceFn, DeviceFn}`, and the high-level `ash::extensions::KhrSwapchain` wrapper is available at `ash::khr::swapchain::{Instance, Device}`.  The extension name and version are found under `ash::khr::swapchain::{NAME, SPEC_VERSION}`.

### Misc helpers

Various miscellaneous helpers have been introduced on low-level Vulkan structs.

For statically-sized arrays with a field bounding their length (e.g. `ash::vk::PhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties::memory_types` with the `memory_types_count` field) a new `_as_slice()` getter is available to retrieve the initialized portion of the slice.

For null-terminated strings stored in statically-sized arrays, both `_as_c_str()` getters and more convenient setter is introduced based on the `CStr` type, providing `Result`-based access to these fields.

### `no_std` support

By disabling the default `std` feature, this crate compiles in a [`no_std` environment](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/intro/no-std.html).

### Added

- Added `std` feature. Disabling this feature makes ash `no_std` (#664)
- Added `Handle::is_null()` to allow checking if a handle is a `NULL` value (#694)
- Allow building `Entry`/`Instance`/`Device` from handle+fns (see their `from_parts_1_x()` associated functions) (#748)
- Update Vulkan-Headers to 1.3.281 (#760, #763, #783, #816, #840)
- Added `VK_NV_memory_decompression` device extension (#761)
- Added `VK_GOOGLE_display_timing` device extension (#765)
- Added `VK_ANDROID_external_memory_android_hardware_buffer` device extension (#769)
- Added `VK_AMD_buffer_marker` device extension (#772)
- Added `VK_AMD_shader_info` device extension (#773)
- Added `VK_AMDX_shader_enqueue` device extension (#776)
- Added `VK_EXT_host_image_copy` device extension (#779)
- Added `VK_KHR_maintenance5` device extension (#780)
- Added `VK_NV_device_generated_commands_compute` device extension (#781)
- Added `VK_KHR_cooperative_matrix` instance extension (#782)
- Added `VK_EXT_vertex_input_dynamic_state` device extension (#784)
- Added `VK_KHR_sampler_ycbcr_conversion` device extension (#785)
- Added `VK_EXT_swapchain_maintenance1` device extension (#786)
- Added `VK_NV_low_latency2` device extension (#802)
- Added `VK_EXT_hdr_metadata` device extension (#804)
- Added `VK_NV_cuda_kernel_launch` device extension (#805)
- Added `descriptor_count()` setter on `ash::vk::WriteDescriptorSet` (#809)
- Added `*_as_c_str()` getters for `c_char` pointers and `c_char` arrays (#831)
- Added `#[must_use]` to Vulkan structs to make it more clear that they are moved by the builder pattern (#845)
- Added `load_with()` function on `Device` and `Instance` for providing custom `get_xxx_proc_addr()` implementations (#846)
- Added `Send`/`Sync` to all Vulkan structs (#869)
- Added `VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering_local_read` device extension (#888)
- Added `VK_KHR_line_rasterization` device extension (#889)
- Added `VK_KHR_calibrated_timestamps` device extension (#890)
- Added `VK_KHR_maintenance6` device extension (#891)

### Changed

- Replaced builders with lifetimes/setters directly on Vulkan structs (#602)
- Inlined struct setters (#602)
- On Fuchsia `libvulkan.so` is now loaded without inexistent `.1` major-version suffix (#626)
- Bumped MSRV from 1.59 to 1.69 (#709, #746)
- Replaced `const fn name()` with associated `NAME` constants (#715)
- Generic builders now automatically set `objecttype` to `<T as Handle>::ObjectType` (#724)
- Separated low-level `*Fn` structs and high-level extension wrappers between instance and device functions, and moved high-level extension wrappers from `ash::extensions::*` to `ash::<prefix>::<extension name>::{Instance, Device}` (#734)
  This not only allows loading `device`-optimized function pointers, it also prevents accidentally loading `instance` functions via `get_device_proc_addr()` which would always return `NULL`, making these `instance` functions always panic on the following high-level extension wrappers:
  - `VK_KHR_swapchain`
  - `VK_KHR_device_group`
  - `VK_EXT_full_screen_exclusive`
  The following extensions containing `instance`-level functions prevented this panic by loading all functions in the `*Fn` loader struct via `get_instance_proc_addr()`, resulting in extra dispatch code inserted by the loader for all `device`-level functions:
  - `VK_KHR_swapchain`
  - `VK_KHR_video_queue`
  - `VK_KHR_device_group`
  - `VK_KHR_performance_query`
  - `VK_EXT_debug_utils`
  - `VK_EXT_sample_locations`
  - `VK_EXT_calibrated_timestamps`
  - `VK_KHR_fragment_shading_rate`
  - `VK_EXT_full_screen_exclusive`
  - `VK_NV_optical_flow`
- `get_calibrated_timestamps()` now returns a single value for `max_deviation` (#738)
- Bumped `libloading` from `0.7` to `0.8` (#739)
- extensions/khr: Take the remaining `p_next`-containing structs as `&mut` to allow chains (#744)
  - `AccelerationStructure::get_acceleration_structure_build_sizes()`
  - `ExternalMemoryFd::get_memory_fd_properties()`
  - `ExternalMemoryWin32::get_memory_win32_handle_properties()`
  - `GetSurfaceCapabilities2::get_physical_device_surface_capabilities2()`
- Define `Display` as `c_void` instead of `*mut c_void` to match Xlib (#751)
- `VK_KHR_device_group_creation`: Take borrow of `Entry` in `fn new()` (#753)
- `VK_KHR_device_group_creation`: Rename `vk::Instance`-returning function from `device()` to `instance()` (#759)
- Windows `HANDLE` types (`HWND`, `HINSTANCE`, `HMONITOR`) are now defined as `isize` instead of `*const c_void` (#797)
- extensions: Make all `vk::Pipeline` and `vk::ShaderEXT` creation functions return their impartial result on error (#828)
  - `VK_AMDX_shader_enqueue`
  - `VK_EXT_shader_object`
  - `VK_KHR_ray_tracing_pipeline`
  - `VK_NV_ray_tracing`
- extensions/ext/ray_tracing_pipeline: Pass indirect SBT regions as single item reference (#829)
- Replaced `c_char` array setters with `CStr` setters (#831)
- `push_next()` functions now allow unsized `p_next` argument (#855)
- Flattened `ash::extensions` into `ash`, and moved `*Fn` function pointer table structs from `ash::vk` into `ash` or the associated extension module (#894)

- Removed misnamed, deprecated `debug_utils_set_object_name()` and `debug_utils_set_object_tag()` entirely, use `set_debug_utils_object_name()` and `set_debug_utils_object_tag()` instead (#661)
- Removed `get_properties` helper from extension wrappers (and `ext::PhysicalDeviceDrm`). Directly call `get_physical_device_properties2()` with a possible chain of multiple structs instead (#728)
- Removed `fn load()` from empty features and extensions (#752)
  - Removed empty `entry_fn_1_2`/`entry_fn_1_3` and getters from `Entry`
  - Removed empty `instance_fn_1_2:` and getters from `Instance`

- The examples were updated to use the new builder pattern
- A SPIR-V parsing function `ash::util::read_spv`
- Added `get_pipeline_cache_data`

### 0.26.0

- Fix loader on MacOS.

- Expose function pointers for easier interop with external libraries.

- Builder now uses bool instead of Bool32.

### 0.25.0

- Adds support for Vulkan 1.1

- Constants are not represented as an `enum` anymore. Constants and flags are both represented as associated constants.

```Rust
flags: vk::COMMAND_POOL_CREATE_RESET_COMMAND_BUFFER_BIT,
//to
flags: vk::CommandPoolCreateFlags::RESET_COMMAND_BUFFER_BIT,

```

- Pretty printing for flags

- Handles can be loaded from outside of ash. See `SomeHandle::from_raw`. This is useful if you need to interact with a C library.

- Removing versioning from ash. `V1_X` are now gone. Versioning had very little benefit in practice, `Entry`, `Instance` and `Device` are now version free. A custom loader can still be implemented. The various traits still remain `DeviceV1_0`.

- `vk.rs` is now generated from `vk.xml`

- Ash now includes all docs inside the `vk.xml`, and are visible in rustdoc.

- `Default` is now implemented for all structs

- There is now a builder pattern

- Handles are now `#[repr(transparent)]`

- Various bug fixes

### 0.18.0

- Fixes arm build => uses libc everywhere. Remove `AlignByteSlice`.

### 0.17.0

- Refactor Align to use vk::DeviceSize.

### 0.16.0

- `map_memory` now returns a void ptr

- `ash::util::Align` is a helper struct that
  can write to aligned memory.
